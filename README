I have two repo for this discord ai
1 is for replit side, which kinda like a cloud ide.
2 is for vscode, which is locally.

WHY need two repo for one project?
replit has some prepare tools like 'secret' that keep sensitive information like token
BUT in vsccode it has no such tools (or maybe extra extension, idk, never try) which WE have to create our own 'secret' tools manually that keep our token safely in .env

<!-- Beside, different runtime port is applied to each side 3000(vscode) and 3001(replit) -->

<!-- Replit - use 3001 runtime (something happen in the replit bash and switching to 3001 is a tempoary usecase for port)
Vscode - use 3000 runtime (when i push from replit to github the runtime is 3001 and some err happened when i pulled down to vsccode because of the 3001 i pushed previously on replit. So i switched the runtime back to 3000 port and it work again.) -->

vscode for experimenting in local machine (fast)
replit for actual deployment
