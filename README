Why Two Repositories?

Replit provides built-in tools like “Secrets”, which securely store sensitive data such as tokens.
VS Code, on the other hand, doesn’t have this feature by default (unless additional extensions are installed).
Therefore, in VS Code, I manually set up a .env file to safely store tokens and other confidential information.



Runtime Differences

Each environment uses a different runtime port:

Replit: Port 3001 (due to certain bash or runtime conditions; this was a temporary setup).

VS Code: Port 3000 (reverted after encountering errors caused by pushing Replit’s 3001 configuration to GitHub and then pulling it back locally).



Purpose of Each Environment

VS Code: For fast, local experimentation and testing.

Replit: For actual deployment and online operation.


I currently maintain two separate repositories for this Discord AI project:

Replit Repository – hosted on Replit (a cloud-based IDE).

VS Code Repository – used locally on my computer.
